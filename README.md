# Sensors
My second task
## Description
### t00:
Create an app that will turn on the LED, run a UART with data processing, and in a loopread one line from UART input and then write it using UART output.
### t01:
Create an app that will get temperature, pressure and humidity from aBME280sensor andwrite them in a console every 10 seconds.
### t02:
Do the same thing as in the previous task, but this time connect a logic analyzer on theSCL and SDA lines and launch the Saleae Logic program.Experiment with how and what information you can get with the analyzer.Take into account that your skills with this tool will be checked during assessments.Sensors|IoTAjax>7
### t03:
Now, let's work with an accelerometer, a magnetometer and a gyroscope.Create an app that will read data from all these sensors for getting a complete pictureof the orientation of the device in space.Take into account that work of the BMI160 sensor must be based on the data from BMM150.
### t04:
This time you will work with a photodetector.Create an app that will measure the luminous flux per unit area. For this, BOOSTXL-SENSORS has anOPT3001 Ambient Light Sensor.The program also must write this data in a console every 10 seconds.
